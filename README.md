# Machine Learning Deep Dive using the famous Iris Flower Dataset 
Here I'm using the basics of machine learning (ML). I'll be building ML pipelines to automate workflows, and will also be teaching myself the basics of both supervised and unsupervised learning. Using pipelines, I will also determine the best ML model for predicting a test set of the Iris Flower dataset. I'll then conduct a quick beginner machine learning project to predict Iris flower species from 4 explanatory variables
